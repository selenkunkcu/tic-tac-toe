## React Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is developed to implement a Tic-Tac-Toe game using React. The project is built using Vite.js for faster development.

# About the Project

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic game played between two players with the objective of getting three symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, on a grid. This project includes the basic rules of this classic game and offers players two symbol options: "X" and "O".

# Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- _React:_ React is a modern JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It follows a component-based approach and supports unidirectional data flow.
- _Vite.js:_ Vite.js is a fast and minimalistic development tool that enables quick start and development processes for modern web projects. It's based on the ESM (ES Module) structure and provides a developer-friendly experience.

# How to Play

- Once the game is loaded, two players can take turns clicking on the grid to place their symbol (either "X" or "O").
- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all cells on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
